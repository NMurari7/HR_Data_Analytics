## FAQs

### 1. What insights can this dashboard provide?
The dashboard allows HR managers to:
- Understand employee work patterns (office, home, and leave percentages).
- Analyze trends in work-from-office and work-from-home attendance over time.
- Identify days with peak attendance or absences.
- Use data to create policies that encourage optimal attendance and flexibility.

### 2. How are percentages for work-from-office, work-from-home, and leave calculated?
Percentages are based on the total working days during a given period:
\[
\text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{Specific Work Type Days}}{\text{Total Working Days}}\right) \times 100
\]
For example, if an employee worked 10 days from the office out of 20 total working days, their work-from-office percentage is **50%**.

### 3. What do the charts represent?
- The **Work-from-Office Trend Chart** displays the fluctuation of office attendance over time.
- The **Work-from-Home Trend Chart** shows how remote work patterns evolve.
- Both charts help visualize seasonal or cyclical trends, making it easier to predict future attendance patterns.

### 4. How does the dashboard identify the day with the highest attendance?
The dashboard aggregates attendance data by day of the week and determines:
- The day with the maximum percentage of work-from-office attendance.
- The day with the highest work-from-home attendance.

This data helps in identifying optimal days for meetings, collaboration, or remote work flexibility.

- Custom date ranges (e.g., weekly, monthly, or yearly views).
